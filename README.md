  The objective of this project was to design and implement a Battleship game using C programming and C embedded programming on the STM32F103RB microcontroller. The primary focus was on developing the embedded C version to leverage the hardware capabilities of the STM32F103RB for a robust and interactive gaming experience. The C version served as a supplementary exercise to reinforce the programming concepts and ensure the game's functionality and logic were thoroughly tested and validated before deployment on the microcontroller. The project aimed to demonstrate proficiency in embedded systems programming, hardware-software integration, and game development.

<p>
  The Battleship game, a classic naval strategy game, has been a popular form of entertainment for decades. Traditionally played on a grid where players take turns guessing the locations of their opponent's ships, the game combines strategic thinking and luck. With advancements in technology, this game has been adapted into various digital formats, providing an engaging way to learn and apply programming skills.
</p>
<p>
  The STM32F103RB microcontroller, part of the STM32 family by STMicroelectronics, is widely used in embedded systems due to its powerful ARM Cortex-M3 core, rich set of peripherals, and ease of integration. Developing a Battleship game on this platform provides an excellent opportunity to explore embedded programming, hardware interfacing, and game logic implementation.
</p>
<p>
  This project involved creating a Battleship game using both standard C programming and C embedded programming for the STM32F103RB. The C version served as a preliminary stage to develop and test the game logic, ensuring a solid foundation for the embedded implementation. The primary challenge and learning opportunity lay in the embedded C version, where the game had to interact with the microcontroller's hardware components, such as the LCD display, buttons, and possibly other peripherals, to create a fully functional and interactive game.
</p>
<p>
  The aim was to leverage the STM32F103RB's capabilities to provide a seamless gaming experience, demonstrating the application of embedded systems knowledge in a real-world scenario. This project not only reinforces programming skills but also highlights the importance of hardware-software co-design in embedded system development.

<br>

- Developing the game using embedded C programming on the STM32F103RB microcontroller. This involved interfacing with various hardware components, such as the LCD display and buttons, to create a functional and interactive game experience
- Designing and implementing the core game logic of Battleship, including grid setup, ship placement, turn-based gameplay, hit/miss detection, and win/loss conditions. Ensuring the game logic was robust and error-free was a primary focus
- Integrating hardware components with the software to ensure smooth and responsive gameplay. This required careful consideration of timing, resource management, and interrupt handling on the microcontroller
- Thoroughly testing the game in both the standard C and embedded C versions to identify and fix bugs, ensure reliability, and optimize performance. This included unit testing, system testing, and user testing to validate the game's functionality
- Documenting the development process, including design decisions, code explanations, and usage instructions. Preparing the project for presentation to demonstrate its features, technical challenges, and learning outcomes

### About the hardware:
1) 1st Led is for Carrier ship and once you power the board it should be active.
2) 2nd Led is for Battle ship and once you power the board it should be active.
3) 3rd Led is for Cruiser ship and once you power the board it should be active.
4) 4th Led is for Submarine ship and once you power the board it should be active.
5) 5th Led is for Destroyer ship and once you power the board it should be active.
6) 6th Led is for Miss where once you target the ship and if ship doesnt exisit, it should active it.
7) 7th Led is for Input row where you have to input a row. It must be below 9; since the grid is 10 by 10.
8) 8th Led is for Column row where you have to input a column, It must be below 9; since the grid is 10 by 10.

### When the game starts
- The user needs to input the the row number they want to attack and press the button. If the number is less than or equal to 9, the user will get to input the column.
Otherwise, the input light will blink 3 times and will let the user to input it again.
- Once the row input is in. The column input light will be on. The user needs to input the column number and press the button. If the input is above 9, it will blink the light 3 times.
Otherwise it will proceed to the next step.
- The program will process the input and will fire back on of the either 1 to 5 leds. This will blink if the ship still has spaces left otherwise it will shut it off indicating that the ship has been sunk.
- If the program doesnt find anything it will blink the miss light one time indigating that the those cordinates dont have the ship.
- User has to sink all the ships in order to win and agter the win the lights will go in pattern indigating that the user has won.
- You can reset the play with the push of the black button on the nucleo.
